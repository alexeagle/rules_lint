# Run linters under Bazel (EXPERIMENTAL)

> It is currently EXPERIMENTAL and pre-release. No support is promised.
> There may be breaking changes, or we may archive and abandon the repository.

This ruleset integrates linting as a first-class concept under Bazel.

Features:

- **No changes needed to rulesets**. Works with the Bazel rules you already use.
- **No changes needed to BUILD files**. You don't need to add lint wrapper macros, and lint doesn't appear in `bazel query` output.
  Instead, users can lint their existing `*_library` targets.
- Lints can be **presented in various ways**:
  - a hard failure, like it would with a `lint_test` rule that fails the build
  - as a warning, using whatever reporting method you prefer
  - or even as bot code review comments (e.g. with [reviewdog])

How developers use it:

1. Run with vanilla Bazel, by placing a couple commands in a shell script, Makefile, or similar wrapper.
2. (preferred) This ruleset provides an Aspect CLI plugin,
   so it can register the missing 'lint' command and users just type `bazel lint //path/to:targets`.

This project is inspired by the design for [Tricorder].
This is how Googlers get their static analysis results in code review (Critique).
https://github.com/google/shipshape is an old, abandoned attempt to open-source Tricorder.

Note: we believe that Formatting is **NOT** Linting.
We have a separate project for formatting, see <https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-super-formatter#design>

### Adding a linter

Please follow the steps in [lint/README.md](./lint/README.md) and then send us a PR.
Thanks!!

## Installation

rules_lint currently only works with bzlmod under Bazel 6+.
This is because we accumulate dependencies which are difficult to express
in a WORKSPACE file.
We might add support for WORKSPACE in the future.

Follow instructions from the release you wish to use:
<https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_lint/releases>

Next, you must declare your linters as Bazel aspects.

> This is needed because Bazel only allows aspect attributes of type
> `bool`, `int` or `string`.
> We want to follow the documentation from
> https://bazel.build/extending/aspects#aspect_definition_2:
> Aspects are also allowed to have private attributes of types label or label_list. Private label attributes can be used to specify dependencies on tools or libraries that are needed for actions generated by aspects.

We suggest creating a `lint.bzl` file in whatever package contains most of your
custom Bazel configuration.
This `lint.bzl` should contain linter aspect declarations.
See the `docs/` folder for "aspect factory functions" that declare your linters.

Finally, reference those linters as `//path/to:lint.bzl%mylinter`
in the lint runner.

If you use the Aspect CLI, then include a block like the following in `.aspect/cli/config.yaml`:

```
plugins:
  - name: lint-plugin
    properties:
      lint_aspects:
        - //:lint.bzl%eslint
        - //:lint.bzl%buf
```

If you don't use Aspect CLI, you can put these in some other wrapper like a shell script that runs the linter aspects over the requested targets.
See the `lint.sh` script in the `example/` folder.
