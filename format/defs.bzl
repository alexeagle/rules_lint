"""Produce a multi-formatter that aggregates formatters.

Some formatter tools are automatically provided by default in rules_lint.
These are listed as defaults in the API docs below.

Other formatter binaries may be declared in your repository.
You can test that they work by running them directly with `bazel run`.

For example, to add prettier, your `BUILD.bazel` file should contain:

```
load("@npm//:prettier/package_json.bzl", prettier = "bin")

prettier.prettier_binary(
    name = "prettier",
    # Allow the binary to be run outside bazel
    env = {"BAZEL_BINDIR": "."},
)
```

and you can test it with `bazel run //path/to:prettier -- --help`.

Then you can register it with `format_multirun`:

```
load("@aspect_rules_lint//format:defs.bzl", "format_multirun")

format_multirun(
    name = "format",
    javascript = ":prettier",
)
```
"""

load("@rules_multirun//:defs.bzl", "command", "multirun")
load("//format/private:formatter_binary.bzl", "CHECK_FLAGS", "DEFAULT_TOOL_LABELS", "FIX_FLAGS", "TOOLS", "to_attribute_name")

def format_multirun(name, **kwargs):
    """Create a multirun binary for the given formatters.

    Intended to be used with `bazel run` to update source files in-place.

    Also produces a target `[name].check` which does not edit files, rather it exits non-zero
    if any sources require formatting.

    Tools are provided by default for some languages.
    These come from the `@multitool` repo.
    Under --enable_bzlmod, rules_lint creates this automatically.
    WORKSPACE users will have to set this up manually. See the release install snippet for an example.

    Set any attribute to `False` to turn off that language altogether, rather than use a default tool.

    Note that `javascript` is a special case which also formats TypeScript, TSX, JSON, CSS, and HTML.

    Args:
        name: name of the resulting target, typically "format"
        **kwargs: attributes named for each language, providing Label of a tool that formats it
