"""API for declaring a PMD lint aspect that visits java_library rules.

Typical usage:

First, call the `fetch_pmd` helper in `WORKSPACE` to download the zip file.
Alternatively you could use whatever you prefer for managing Java dependencies, such as a Maven integration rule.

Next, declare a binary target for it, typically in `tools/lint/BUILD.bazel`:

```starlark
java_binary(
    name = "pmd",
    main_class = "net.sourceforge.pmd.PMD",
    runtime_deps = ["@net_sourceforge_pmd"],
)
```

Finally, declare an aspect for it, typically in `tools/lint/linters.bzl`:

```starlark
load("@aspect_rules_lint//lint:pmd.bzl", "pmd_aspect")

pmd = pmd_aspect(
    binary = "@@//tools/lint:pmd",
    rulesets = ["@@//:pmd.xml"],
)
```
